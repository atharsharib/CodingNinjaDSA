Given two integers a and b. You need to find and return the count of possible ways in which we can represent the number a as the sum of unique integers raise to the power b.
For example: if a = 10 and b = 2, only way to represent 10 as sum of unique integers raised to power 2 is-
10 = 1^2 + 3^2 
Hence, answer is 1.
Note : x^y represents x raise to the power y
Input Format:
The first line of input contains two space separated integers, that denote the value of a and b.
Output Format:
The first and only line of output contains count of ways in which a can be represented as sum of unique integers raised to power b.
Constraints :
1 <= a <= 10^4
1 < b <= 20
Time Limit: 1 second
Sample Input 1 :
10 2
Sample Output 1 :
1




#include<cmath>

int getAllWays(int a,int b,int i=1){
	if(a<pow(i,b)) return 0;
	if(a==pow(i,b)) return 1;
	int x=getAllWays(a-pow(i,b),b,i+1);
	int y=getAllWays(a,b,i+1);
    return x+y;
}
